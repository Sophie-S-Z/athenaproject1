This is a tribute website dedicated to The Queen’s Gambit, my favorite show. It’s a static site built using HTML and CSS that brings together some of the things I found most powerful and memorable about the story: the complexity of chess, the elegance of Beth Harmon’s character, and the dark yet refined aesthetic of the world that the show depicts.

The site includes a few interactive and thematic elements that reflect the show’s atmosphere and tone. I added quotes from real-life chess grandmasters, a chess coin flip feature, and a section featuring famous chess openings. The layout and color scheme were inspired by the show's progression, and it uses deeper and richer colors to match Beth’s development over time. There’s also a reference to the old money aesthetic that the visuals of the series are known for.

I made this project because The Queen’s Gambit left a significant impression on me after I finished it. As a competitive person who also enjoys chess, I related to Beth’s focus, drive, and internal struggles. Creating a website that reflects that story gave me the chance to combine my interests in design and coding into something creative I could personally share with the world. 

I used HTML and CSS to structure and style the site. I focused on having a clean, visually appealing layout, good typography, and consistent styling. I also tried to be intentional with design decisions like color choices, fonts, and spacing to give the site a cohesive look that fits the theme.

I had trouble getting the layout to look clean and organized and found myself constantly tweaking the CSS to fix image formatting and spacing issues. Centering elements and making things responsive were harder than I expected. I also spent a lot of time thinking about how to create a visual atmosphere similar to the show without going over the top.

From this project, I learned how small changes in layout and color can completely change the mood of a site. I also learned to be more patient with the design process and more comfortable trying things that didn’t work the first time. It reminded me that coding and design are all about the process of trial and error.

This site is a personal project that lets me explore what I enjoy about chess, design, and creative expression through code. If you’re a fan of The Queen’s Gambit, I hope you’ll deem this site a sufficient tribute (however basic it may be).
