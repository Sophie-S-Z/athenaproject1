A tribute website to my favorite show, The Queen's Gambit, built using HTML and CSS. I included chess elements (quotes from grandmasters, a chess coin flip, and famous chess openings) and Beth's style as she progressed and matured throughout the show. I used deeper and darker colors that reminded me of the show's vibe and a sort of "old money" aesthetic. This is my first submission for the Athena Awards.
